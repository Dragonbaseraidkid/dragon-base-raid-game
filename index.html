  <h1>🐉⚔️ Dragon Base Raid</h1>

  <h2>Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Team 1: 2 players</li>
    <li>Team 2: 2 players</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 bases (trees, cones, chairs, or stick circles)</li>
    <li>1 dragon egg in each base</li>
    <li>Bases 15–20 steps apart</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Roles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Defender:</strong> Guards egg, tags attackers, stays within 5 steps of the base.</li>
    <li><strong>Raider:</strong> Runs to the other base to steal the egg and can tag the other raider anywhere on the field.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If a defender tags a raider, that raider must return to their own base line before trying again.</li>
    <li>If a raider tags the other raider, the tagged raider freezes for 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>If a raider is tagged while holding the egg, they drop it on the ground where they were tagged.</li>
    <li>The defender picks up the dropped egg and returns it to their base.</li>
    <li>The first team to steal the other team’s egg and bring it safely back to their own base wins the round.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advanced Modes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mode 1 – Double Egg Raid:</strong> Each base has 2 eggs. Steal both to win.</li>
    <li><strong>Mode 2 – Timed Siege:</strong> If no egg is stolen in 2–3 minutes, the team whose raider got closest to the enemy egg most times wins.</li>
    <li><strong>Mode 3 – Sudden Death:</strong> Once the egg is picked up, defenders may move anywhere. If the egg carrier is tagged, the round ends with no winner.</li>
    <li><strong>Mode 4 – Role Swap Round:</strong> After each round, swap defender and raider roles.</li>
  </ul>
